                        Live on Lan uses both a deviceâ€™s inherent Wake-On-Lan capabilities coupled with a custom service 
                        running on the target device to offer both wake up and shut down functionality.
                        Wake-On-Lan functionality has to be enabled in the BIOS of the device. 
                        Shutdown functionality requires a app to be installed on the target devices. 
                        This app can be downloaded at https://liveonlan.com/downloads
                        Export / Import functionality allows for saving and restoring app settings.</Text>
